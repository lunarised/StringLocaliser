# StringLocaliser
A Tool to help localize strings in LCL

## Current Roadblocks
* Not all localisable strings are stored in TSX files. While this program will get alot of them, I will miss many named strings in the code
* Managing writing streams may be difficult. 
* Finding the strings to localize in the code will be a non trivial task, which is somewhat scary
